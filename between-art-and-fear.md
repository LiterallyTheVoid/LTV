# Between Art And Fear

All of the decisions that I have made in my life have largely been under the pretense of fear. I don’t think that this is an uncommon occurrence. It is so hard to feel. But there is a thin veil between sickness and wellness. 

For me the, the barrier is very thin. I can feel it every day. That is the pretense that I had do make the decision of what I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing. I needed something that would allow me to live. Something that will allow me to live, even under the most basic circumstances. 

I started university studying engineering, and I graduated with a degree in English. Now my job is software engineering. I write code and create software for a living. I have enough money, and, more importantly, I have the benefits that I need in order to just be alive. 

But that leaves my in a very difficult place. Caught between art and fear. 

I love my work. In fact, it has a lot in common with writing. It is indeed a craft. Yes is it has the gleam of pure technicality, but building software is more akin to be a carpenter than being a chemist. 

I have now have the space to create. The issue is what to create. Becoming an adult makes it apparent how finite our time here is. What came before is uncertain, what came after is uncertain. But now, we at least have the smallest amount of control. 

I love building software, but it’s not fulfilling the way that writing is. Even now, I love the writing that I am doing. This sentence makes me happier than all the code that I have developed. 

Yet here I am. Stuck between art and fear. I have the space to create, and yet I don’t do it. 

I used to think that I was afraid that if I didn’t do something that kept me alive, and that was the thing that kept me from following art. But now I can see the fear of death isn’t keeping me from creation. Fear of creation is keeping me from creating.
