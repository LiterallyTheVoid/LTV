# Between Art And Fear

All of the decisions that I have made in my life have largely been under the pretense of fear. I donâ€™t think that this is an uncommon occurrence. It is so hard to feel. But there is a thin veil between sickness and wellness. 

For me the, the barrier is very thin. I can feel it every day. That is the pretense that I had do make the decision of what I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing. I needed something that would allow me to live. Something that will allow me to live, even under the most basic circumstances. 

I started university studying engineering, and I graduated with a degree in English. Now my job is software engineering. I write code and create software for a living. I have enough money, and, more importantly, I have the benefits that I need in order to just be alive. 

But that leaves my in a very difficult place. Caught between art and fear. 

I love my work. In fact, it has a lot in common with writing. It is indeed a craft. Yes is it has the gleam of pure technicality, but building software is more akin to be a carpenter than being a chemist.
