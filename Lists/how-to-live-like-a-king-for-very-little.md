# Being Better

## Introduction

I think that it takes a bit of time to realize how far we have fallen from what we really wanted to be. 

I need to get better. I need to be better. 

As with many of these points, these is going to be a substantial amount of crossover. That’s life, each area bleeds into the other. As much as we might wish to, it is impossible to cleanly separate ourselves. Why would you want to anyway. Your beauty is in your wholeness.

This is the plan, broken into several different categories.

## Nutrition

### Track what you are doing

This is going to be the base line with most of these things. You need to track what you are eating and what you are taking into your body. You need to track how long you are fasting.

### Practice Intermittent Fasting Protocol

Intermittent fasting is good for your body and mind. It also allows you to really practice self-discipline. If you have never done something like this, there are a series of steps that you can take in order to get to a 16 hour fasting period, which I would recommend. 

Remember, sleeping counts as fasting, so use that to your advantage.

### Don’t Drink

Drinking is bad. It’s not good for your body, it’s not good for your mental clarity, its not good for your wallet. You don’t need it, and you shouldn’t really want it 

### Don't Drink Pop

Take it from someone that has drank a lot of pop. You don’t need, and you don’t want it. Diet pop is chemical slug, and regular pop is a chemical sludge plus sugar. They aren’t good for your body, and they aren’t good for your wallet. 

I don’t have the evidence to back this up, but I don’t think that they are good for your mental clarity either. They are addictive and you don’t need them, and that should be enough.

### Don't Smoke

Smoking and vaping are generally bad. I will say that the one caveat is the medicinal properties of cannabis. However, there are better methods of consumption for cannabis, and you should try and utilize those methods. Over smoking, which is bad for the lungs no matter how you slice it.

### Drink 3-4 liters of water a day. More if you're consuming caffiene.

Water is the liquid of life, and you body needs it. Most people are chronically dehydrated, especially if you really keep track of how much water you are taking into your body.

Get a big ass water bottle and keep with you.

Drink water before and after you eat.

You will pee a lot at first, but after a few days your body will adjust to the new volume.

### Buy most of your food from the produce section.

Your goal now is to eat the healthiest, whole foods that you can get. Sometimes this will be more expensive, sometimes this will be cheaper. 

Eat simple foods and meals. You are trying to get a lot of bang for your nutritional buck.

Make sure that you still eat the tings you enjoy.

## Training

### Track What You Are Doing

You need to track what you are doing in the gym. This is to make sure that you are improving.

### Warm Up

No matter what you are doing, you need to make sure that you are warming up. This is to prevent injury, but is also going to help you improve faster. Warming up is the ultimate pre-workout.

### Cool Down

Same as warming up. It will prevent injury and allow you to recover faster. Stretch, and I mean really stretch. Muscles locking up causes pains. You want to keep that mobility going. 

Get a foam roller. They are great. They help loosen up muscles, and they help you recover faster.

### Lift Weights

Resistance training is good for you. Really good for you. It will help you reduce stress. It will make you more attractive. It will make you happier. Find a program that you like and still to it. Make sure that you track what you are doing. 

### Cardio

Find some cardio that you love. For me, it is martial arts training. I love working on the bag. HIIT, LISS or whatever. It doesn’t matter, just find something that you can tolerate and do it. No one likes cardio, but it is important.

## Finances

### Drive a cheap, fuel-efficient car that is cheap and easy to fix. 

Cars are really something that gets you from pooping A to point B. Sure, cool cars are cool, but those resources could better spend. There is a reason the Camry is one of the most popular cars ever designed.

### Don’t Drive

Speaking of driving, don’t do it. I know that this is very difficult to do in the United States, but as much as you can, try not to drive. Walk, bike, bum rides. 

### Don’t Have Kids

They are expensive. A kid, on average, costs about a million dollars. If you can afford it, do it. But I would rather have the million.

### Buy reasonable clothes

You don’t need designer clothes, but make sure that you are buying stuff that you like, that you want to wear, and that will last a while. Basics are the way to go. 

### Avoid Preventable Expenses

Did you know that a house, on average, requires 3% of its value on a yearly basis in maintenance? 

Find a way to make sure that you can do this maintenance. Make sure that your home is order, even the little things. This is true for all aspects of your life. 

Maintaining is far cheaper than replacing.

### Avoid Sickness And Injury

Life finds a way, but there are thing that you can do to make sure that you won’t get sick or injured. Warm up. Cool down. Drive safe. Use a condom.
